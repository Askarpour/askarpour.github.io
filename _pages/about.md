<h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>

I am an Adjunct Professor at McMaster University and a Senior ADAS (Active Safety and Autonomous Driving) Safety Design Software Architect at General Motors Canada.

From April 2020 to April 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the [McSCert Research Team](https://www.mcscert.ca/) in the Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University, following a brief visiting period from August to October 2019. During this time, I focused on model-based safety analysis of automotive software in a [project](https://www.mcscert.ca/index.html%3Fp=1521.html) funded by General Motors.

Prior to this, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher with the [DeepSE](https://www.deepse.deib.polimi.it/) Group at Politecnico di Milano from January 2018 to March 2020, where I also earned my PhD under the supervision of Prof. [Dino Mandrioli](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ricerche/RicercaPerDocentiPublic.do?evn_didattica=EVENTO&&aa=2019&k_cf=-1&k_corso_la=-1&ac_ins=0&lang=EN&tipoCorso=ALL_TIPO_CORSO&semestre=ALL_SEMESTRI&tipoInsegnamento=ALL_TIPO_INSEGNAMENTO&sede=ALL_SEDI&n_docente=dino&k_doc=231476&tab_ricerca=2) (November 2014 - January 2018). My research involved a collaborative project with [STIIMA-CNR](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/), aimed at developing software solutions for human safety in collaborative robotics. Specifically, we utilized model checking and temporal logic to model various task execution scenarios in collaborative robotics and identify and mitigate hazardous traces that could endanger human operators.

Additionally, I briefly collaborated with Prof. [Di Nitto](https://dinitto.faculty.polimi.it/) on the [SODALITE](https://www.sodalite.eu/) European Project. This project aimed to simplify the deployment of heterogeneous systems by enabling developers to describe their applications using high-level semantic abstractions and target generic abstracted execution platforms to establish a runtime bootstrap environment. I implemented a [component](https://github.com/SODALITE-EU/iac-blueprint-builder) that generates Infrastructure as Code blueprints in TOSCA notation from model instances defined in the project, which are then deployed by users through the SODALITE IDE.

My research interests include formal verification, model-based safety analysis, and the application of model checking in autonomous systems and robotics.
