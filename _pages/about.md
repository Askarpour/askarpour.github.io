<h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>

I am an adjunct Professor at McMaster University and a lead software safety analyst at SDV (Software Defined Vehicles) -- General Motors Canada.

I was a postdoc at [Mcscert Research Team](https://www.mcscert.ca/mcscert-research-team/), Department of Computing and Software, McMaster University from April 2020 to April 2021, following a short visiting period in 2019 (Aug - Oct). I worked on the model-based safety analysis of automotive software in a [project](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/mcmaster-engineering-researchers-awarded-funding-advance-software-safety-next-generation) funded by General Motors.

I worked as a Postdoc at [Deepse Group](https://www.deepse.deib.polimi.it/), Politecnico di Milano from Jan 2018 to March 2020, where I received my PhD (Nov 2014 - Jan 2018) under the supervision of [Prof. Dino Mandrioli](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ricerche/RicercaPerDocentiPublic.do?evn_didattica=EVENTO&&aa=2019&k_cf=-1&k_corso_la=-1&ac_ins=0&lang=EN&tipoCorso=ALL_TIPO_CORSO&semestre=ALL_SEMESTRI&tipoInsegnamento=ALL_TIPO_INSEGNAMENTO&sede=ALL_SEDI&n_docente=dino&k_doc=231476&tab_ricerca=2). I worked on a joint project with [STIIMA - CNR](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/en/) to provide software solutions for human safety in collaborative robotics. In particular, we employed model checking and temporal logic to model all the variations of task execution in collaborative robotic scenarios and identify and mitigate hazardous traces that could endanger the human operator.

I also shortly worked with [Prof. Di Nitto](https://dinitto.faculty.polimi.it/) on [SODALITE European Project](https://www.sodalite.eu/).  The goal of this project is to increase the simplicity of deploying heterogeneous systems and enabling developers to describe their applications once, using high level semantic abstractions and targeting generic abstracted execution platform to bring-up a runtime bootstrap environment. 
I Implemented a [component](https://github.com/SODALITE-EU/iac-blueprint-builder) that creates Infrastructure as Code blueprints in TOSCA notation from model instances defined in the project, whose output later is deployed by the user through the SODALITE IDE. 

My research interests are formal verification, model-based safety analysis and application of model checking in autonomous systems and robotics.
