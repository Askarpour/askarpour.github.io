<h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
I had the privilege of co-advising a group of highly motivated students in a course led by [Prof. Di Nitto](https://dinitto.faculty.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano. Together, we explored efficient implementations of existing quantum circuits using the IBM Qiskit library and conducted state-of-the-art analyses across various subdomains of quantum computing.
Below are two of our published works:

* “Generalizing an Exactly-1 SAT Solver for Arbitrary Numbers of Variables, Clauses, and K” (2020). In: 1st Quantum Software Engineering and Technology Workshop (QSET). [More details](https://github.com/Megapiro/Quantum-Computing) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1xtlKiuA0k).

* "Experimental Implementation of Discrete Time Quantum Walk with the IBM Qiskit Library" (2021). In: Second International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE). Co-located with ICSE 2021. [More details](https://github.com/Askarpour/sw2_quantum_research/tree/master/Olivieri) and [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHR96aF-HkM).

<h3>Agile Development of Safety Critical Systems</h3>
After working in the automotive industry and witnessing the challenges of transforming an automaking company into a tech-focused enterprise, I developed an interest in researching the practical issues surrounding agile development for safety-critical systems. This interest culminated in the article below.

* "An Exploration of Agile Methods in the Automotive Industry: Benefits, Challenges and Opportunities" (2024). [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12676)
